# GoldenPulse.AI - Modular Architecture Context

## Overview
This document describes the modular architecture implementation for GoldenPulse.AI, a wellness platform for Indian seniors.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Module Structure
```
src/modules/
├── core/                 # Core infrastructure
│   ├── di/              # Dependency injection
│   ├── interfaces/      # Module contracts
│   ├── logging/         # Centralized logging
│   └── quality/         # Quality assurance tools
├── fitness/             # Health scoring and recommendations
├── dashboard/           # Widget management and data flow
├── games/              # Cognitive training games
├── shared/             # Common utilities and services
└── index.ts            # Module orchestrator
```

### 2. Design Principles

#### Modular Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one domain
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling through DI container
- **Interface Contracts**: Strict typing for module communication
- **Event-Driven**: Modules communicate through events when needed

#### Code Quality
- **JSDoc with @ai_context**: Every function documented for AI understanding
- **Structured Logging**: Module-specific loggers for debugging
- **Error Boundaries**: Centralized error handling
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks for each module

### 3. Module Dependencies
```
Core (logging, DI, quality) 
├── Fitness (health calculations)
├── Dashboard (UI coordination) 
│   └── depends on: Fitness
└── Games (cognitive training)
```

### 4. Service Registration
Services are registered with the DI container during module initialization:
- `fitnessService`: Health calculations and recommendations
- `dashboardService`: Widget data management
- `gamesService`: Game progress and scoring

### 5. Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Existing imports still work through re-exports
- Component interfaces unchanged
- No breaking changes to UI components

## AI Context System

### @ai_context Documentation
Every health-related function now includes comprehensive AI context:
- **Medical Rationale**: Why specific algorithms are used
- **Population Adaptation**: How guidelines are adapted for Indian seniors
- **Clinical Significance**: Weight and importance in overall health assessment
- **Integration Points**: How functions connect to other modules

### #ai-reason Tags
Inline comments explaining:
- Implementation decisions and trade-offs
- Medical/clinical justifications
- Safety considerations for health calculations
- User experience design choices

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Medical-Grade ESLint Configuration
- **Safety Rules**: Prevents unsafe patterns in health calculations
- **Documentation Enforcement**: Requires @ai_context for health functions
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript rules for health data
- **Custom Rules**: Healthcare-specific linting patterns

### Impact Assessment Tool
- **Risk Analysis**: Evaluates change impact on health calculations
- **Dependency Mapping**: Tracks module interdependencies
- **Test Coverage**: Recommends required testing for changes
- **Deployment Safety**: Provides risk-based deployment recommendations

### User Correction Tracking
- **Learning System**: Captures user feedback on AI decisions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring AI mistakes
- **Medical Review**: Escalates critical health calculation errors
- **Continuous Improvement**: Builds knowledge base from corrections

## Knowledge Management System

### Decision Logs (NDJSON)
Structured logging of all architectural and medical decisions:
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-05-24T04:30:00Z", "type": "architecture", "decision": "Implemented modular architecture", "impact": "high"}
```

### Pattern Library
Reusable patterns for:
- Age-normalized health calculations
- Risk assessment algorithms
- Progressive scoring systems
- Cultural health adaptations

### User Corrections Database
Tracks and learns from:
- Calculation corrections by medical professionals
- UI/UX improvements suggested by seniors
- Recommendation accuracy feedback
- Cultural adaptation needs
